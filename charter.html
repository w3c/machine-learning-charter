        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>Enabling Machine Learning inference in
          the browser (as opposed e.g. to in the cloud) enhances privacy, since input
          data such as locally sourced images or video streams stay within the
          browser's sandbox. Local processing also enables machine learning use
          cases that require low latency, such as object detection in immersive
          web experiences.
        <p>
          Currently, machine learning inference in the browser uses the WebGL
          graphics API with limited or no access to platform capabilities
          beneficial for ML such as CPU parallelism, general-purpose GPU, or
          dedicated ML hardware accelerators.
        </p>

      </section>
      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Web Machine Learning Working Group develops a Web API aiming to expose generic capabilities to the Web
          required to provide close-to-native machine learning performance in
          the browser. 
          This Web API for neural network inference hardware acceleration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allow to construct a neural network computational graph by common
          building blocks, including constant values and base operations such
          as convolution, pooling, softmax, normalization, fully connected,
          activation, recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory
          (LSTM);
          </li>
          <li>Allow to compile the neural network to native optimized format
          for hardware execution;
          </li>
          <li>Allow to setup input from various sources on the Web, e.g. array
          buffers, media streams, schedule the asynchronous hardware execution,
          and retrieve the output when hardware execution completes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The APIs in scope of this group will not be tied to any particular
          platform and will be implementable on top of existing major platform
          APIs, such as Android Neural Networks API, Windows DirectML, and
          macOS/iOS Metal Performance Shaders and Basic Neural Network
          Subroutines.

          <h3 id="out-of-scope">
            Out of Scope
          </h3>
          <p>
            The scope is limited to development of interfaces that expose
            inference capabilities of the modern platforms beneficial or
            purpose-built for ML. Training capabilities are out of scope due to
            limited availability of respective platform APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Working Group will not define any hardware features or
            algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid overlap with existing work, generic primitives used by
            traditional machine learning algorithms such as base linear algebra
            operations are out of scope. The WebGL and WebGPU shaders and
            WebAssembly SIMD are expected to address these requirements, see
            the Coordination section for details.

              The WebAssembly Community Group incubates a proposal for a
              128-bit SIMD support in WebAssembly that can be used to implement
              traditional machine learning algorithms efficiently. The Web

              The Khronos WebGL Working Group defines a WebGL API that supports
              the OpenGL ES Shading Language (GLSL). The GLSL can be used to
              implement traditional machine learning algorithms efficiently.
              Furthermore, this group incubates a proposal for a WebGL 2.0
              Compute specification that aims to provide an efficient way to
              run general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing workloads such as
              machine learning algorithms in the WebGL context.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more
          active participants for its duration, including representatives from
          the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and
          Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors,
          and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per
          week towards the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum
          requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public
          mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href=

        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
          submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent

          Participants in the group are required (by the <a href=

          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">
          public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face
          meetings will be archived for public review, and technical
          discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can
          be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and
          Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public
          repository and may permit direct public contribution requests. The
          meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables,

        <p>
          Most Web Machine Learning Working Group teleconferences will focus on

          as-needed basis.

          This group primarily conducts its technical work on GitHub issues.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.

        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases
          when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from
          one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of
          the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the
          end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
          consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href=
