        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>
          Computer Vision enables computers to gain understanding from images
          or videos, Natural Language Processing enables interaction between
          computers and human languages, and Speech Recognition enables
          computers to recognize and translate spoken language into text.
          Bringing these experiences to the web in a privacy-preserving manner
          requires efficient machine learning inference capabilities built into
          the browser.
        </p>
        <p>Enabling Machine Learning inference in
          the browser (as opposed e.g. to in the cloud) enhances privacy, since input
          data such as locally sourced images or video streams stay within the
          browser's sandbox. Local processing also enables machine learning use
          cases that require low latency, such as object detection in real-time
	  communications and immersive web experiences.
        <p>
          Currently, machine learning inference in the browser uses WebAssembly
	  and the WebGL
          graphics API with limited or no access to platform capabilities
          beneficial for ML such as CPU parallelism, general-purpose GPU, or
          dedicated ML hardware accelerators.

        <h2>
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Web Machine Learning Working Group develops a Web API aiming to expose generic capabilities to the Web
          required to provide close-to-native machine learning performance in
          the browser. 
          This Web API for neural network inference hardware acceleration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allows construction of a neural network computational graph by common
          building blocks required by well-known model architectures: constant
          values and base operations such as convolution, pooling, softmax,
          normalization, fully connected, and activation;
          </li>
          <li>Allows compilation of the neural network to native optimized format
          for hardware execution;
          </li>
          <li>Allows input to be set up from various sources on the Web, e.g. array
          buffers and media streams, schedule the asynchronous hardware execution,
          and retrieve the output when hardware execution completes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This Working Group puts priority on building blocks required by
          well-known model architectures such as recurrent neural network
          (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformers in the fields
          of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Speech
          Recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APIs in scope of this group are not tied to any particular
          platform and are implementable on top of existing major platform
          APIs, such as Android Neural Networks API, Windows DirectML, and
          macOS/iOS Metal Performance Shaders and Basic Neural Network
          Subroutines.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each high-level building block that decomposes into well-known
          lower-level operations, the APIs will informatively define a generic
          emulation path to allow for future extensibility.
        </p>
        <p>The Working Group may also work on a higher-level API to load a custom pre-trained Machine Learning model for inference in the browser.</p>
        <section id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">
            Out of Scope
          </h3>
          <p>
            The scope is limited to development of interfaces that expose
            inference capabilities of the modern platforms beneficial or
            purpose-built for ML. Training capabilities are out of scope due to
            limited availability of respective platform APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Working Group will not define any hardware features or
            algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid overlap with existing work, alignment with the Basic
            Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) interface is out of scope. The
            WebGPU shaders and WebAssembly SIMD are expected to address the
            BLAS compatibility requirement, see the <a href="#coordination">Coordination section</a> for
            details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Integration between the WebNN and WebGL APIs is out of scope, as the group focuses its efforts on integration with WebGPU APIs.

              The Web Machine Learning Community Group developed the
              Web Neural Network API adopted by this Working Group. It is
              expected that the Community Group will continue drive technical
              work around other specifications in its scope. This Working Group
              will work with the Web Machine Learning Community Group
              on shaping the <a href="#tentative">Tentative Specifications</a>

              operation set that makes frameworks easier to deploy across
              different hardware. WebNN API targets diverse hardware platforms
              and defines an operation set whose high-level operations can be
              decomposed to low level primitives that can map to StableHLO
              operations. Coordination and alignment between these two
              operation sets is beneficial to the open ML ecosystem.

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more
          active participants for its duration, including representatives from
          the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and
          Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors,
          and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per
          week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum
          requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public
          mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href=
          '#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
          submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of
          the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent
          Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants in the group are required (by the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C
          Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href=

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">
          public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face
          meetings will be archived for public review, and technical
          discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can
          be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and
          Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public
          repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The
          meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables,
          issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be

        <p>
          Most Web Machine Learning Working Group teleconferences will focus on
          discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an
          as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on GitHub issues.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases
          when a participant requests such a discussion.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from
          one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of
          the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the
          end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
          consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document
          (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond
          what the Process Document requires.
